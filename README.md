## What I learned

- create a new branch with git:

```
git checkout -b my-branch
```

- switch between branch (my-branch and master), get out of my-branch and go to master branch:

```
git checkout master
```

- delete branch

```
git branch -d my-branch
```

- check branches

```
git branch
```

- add and commit at the same time for modified file

```
git commit -am 'edit index.html'
```

- undo gits
  make some changes

```
git reset [file name]
```
